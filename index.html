        <h1>ABBA's Kingdom Program</h1>
        <h2>A Revolutionary, Blue Ocean Movement Powered by the Holy Spirit</h2>
        <p>
            This is more than a financial program; it is a **trailblazing Kingdom strategy** grounded in **Ephesians 3:20-21**: <i>"Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us."</i>  
        </p>
        <p>
            With the guidance of the Holy Spirit, this program is a **blue ocean strategy**, creating a new space where the traditional boundaries of charity, business, and community investment are expanded to reflect God's Kingdom on Earth.  
        </p>
        <h3>Key Scriptures Underpinning the Vision</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Isaiah 43:19:</strong> "See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?"</li>
            <li><strong>Matthew 6:33:</strong> "Seek first His Kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."</li>
            <li><strong>Acts 2:44-45:</strong> "All the believers were together and had everything in common."</li>
