  <h2>Program Overview</h2>
  <p>ABBA's Kingdom Donation Program is more than just a financial initiativeâ€”it's a Kingdom-shifting movement that empowers believers to receive and share God's generosity for Life more abundantly. Through this program, we are not only impacting individual lives but also transforming entire communities, businesses, and families by demonstrating the expressed image of Messiah Jesus and His abundance. Each donation and contribution sown into this program will multiply in ways that honor and build up the Kingdom of God on earth.</p>
