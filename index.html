        <h1>ABBA's Kingdom Donation Program</h1>
        <h2>Empowered by the Holy Spirit - Revolutionizing Giving and Kingdom Impact</h2>
        <p>
            ABBA's Kingdom Donation Program is the fulfillment of <strong>Ephesians 3:20-21:</strong> 
            <i>"Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us, to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever!"</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            This Holy Spirit-inspired vision creates a movement of generosity that transforms lives, businesses, communities, and nations. Modeled after the early church in Acts 2:45, this program channels resources to fulfill God’s mission and purpose in every sphere of life, creating an environment where Kingdom principles flourish.
        </p>
        <p>
            **Isaiah 43:19** encapsulates this program perfectly: 
            <i>"See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland."</i>
        </p>
