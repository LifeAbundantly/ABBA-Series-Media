        <h3>Biblical Foundation</h3>
        <p>**Acts 2:44-47 (NIV):**  
        “All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.”</p>
        <p>This program reflects these principles by creating a sustainable, faith-driven community of givers and receivers, united under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p>
